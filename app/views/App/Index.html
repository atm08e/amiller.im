      <p>Hi, I am Andrew (Drew) Miller. I particularly like building applications in Go, Python, PHP, and C++. I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Florida State University in fall 2012.</p>
      <p>Since then I worked at a Mobile Device Management company called Openpeak from 2013-2016, and more recently I will start working at Ultimate Software in Weston starting mid March.</p>
      <p>This website is a work in progress and will be updated rapidly in the comming days/weeks (3/2/16)</p>
